        <img src="pupusa.jpg" height="225" width="300" </img> 
    <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This is a fairly authentic version of the popular Salvadorean dish. It does take some time, however it is well worth the effort! You can purchase pre-made chicharron at specialty markets, however this recipe tastes just like it.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>

    <h5> Salsa Roja</h5>
        <ul>4 cups plain tomato sauce</ul>
        <ul>1 cup water</ul>     
        <ul>4 bunches fresh cilantro, chopped</ul> 
        <ul>1 green bell pepper, seeded and chopped</ul> 
        <ul>1 onion, chopped </ul>  
        <ul>2 cloves garlic, crushed (Optional)</ul>
        <ul>1 cube chicken bouillon</ul>
        <ul>salt to taste</ul>
    <h5>Chicharron</h5>      
        <ul>1 (12 ounce) package bacon, or to taste</ul>
        <ul>4 tomatoes, halved, or more to taste</ul> 
        <ul>1 green bell pepper, seeded and quartered</ul> 
        <ul>1 cup grated Monterey Jack cheese</ul> 
        <ul>2 cloves garlic, minced (Optional)</ul> 
        <ul>salt to taste</ul> 
        <ul>4 cups masa harina, or more to taste</ul>
        <ul>2 cups water, or as needed</ul> 
        <ul>Â½ cup vegetable oil for frying</ul>
    <h4>Directions</h4>
        <ol>1. Combine tomato sauce, water, cilantro, green bell pepper, onion, crushed garlic, bouillon cube, and salt in a saucepan over medium-low heat. Cook and stir until vegetables are soft, about 20 minutes. Let salsa roja cool for 10 minutes.</ol>
        <ol>2. Fill a blender halfway with the salsa roja. Cover and hold lid down with a potholder; pulse a few times before leaving on to blend. Pour into a bowl. Repeat with remaining salsa roja. Return to saucepan and simmer for 10 minutes more stirring occasionally. Allow to cool completely, about 1 hour, and refrigerate.</ol>
        <ol>3. Place cabbage and carrots in a large bowl. Add 4 cups boiling water and let stand for 5 minutes. Drain well. Mix in vinegar, scallions, oregano, and red pepper flakes. Chill curtido until serving.</ol> 
        <ol>4. Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until almost fully cooked and not yet crispy, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer bacon and grease (if desired) to a food processor. Add tomatoes, quartered green bell pepper, Monterey Jack cheese, and minced garlic. Puree and season the chicharron with salt.</ol>
        <ol>5. Mix masa harina and 1/2 cup water together in a bowl by hand. Add the remaining water slowly, about 2 tablespoons at a time, mixing well after each addition, until dough is moist but still firm. Cover with a wet towel.</ol>
        <ol>6. Heat 1/2 cup oil a large skillet over medium-high heat.</ol>
        <ol>7. Take a golf ball-sized piece of dough and roll into a ball in your hands. Make a hole in the dough ball with your thumb; put a small amount of chicharron inside the hole, close it up, and flatten the ball with your hands into a thick tortilla shape. Place pupusa in the skillet and fry until golden brown, about 2 minutes per side. Repeat with the remaining dough and chicharron.</ol>
        <ol>8. Serve each pupusa topped with 2 tablespoons of curtido and 1 tablespoon of salsa roja.</ol>
